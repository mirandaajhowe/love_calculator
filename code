# This program interacts with the Love Calculator API. It retrieves data on
# compatibility between different names and transforms the data into a fun
# app which allows user to enter specific searches and then delivers a message
# based on the data the search retrieves.

# The Love Calculator API is free to use but you need to register in order to
# obtain a private access key, which you should replace 'YOUR-KEY!!!' below with.

# The random module is inbuilt, but the requests module needs to be downloaded:
# in your IDE, hover over the module and then click 'Download', or manually
# download it in your Terminal using the pip install command.
